00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.590
Take a look at this
cup of coffee.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.470
Does it make you feel
anything? Not much, right? Okay.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.245
How about this cup?

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.134
If you know Starbucks,

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:26.155
maybe this cup makes you feel
comforted, relaxed, warm.

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:28.415
For me personally, it brings up

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:30.680
all sorts of memories
and associations.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.970
It reminds me of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.345
cozy winter days,
fireplaces, white chocolate

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:38.690
mochas. If you don't
know Starbucks,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.805
this might sound like
nonsense to you.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:41.660
In that case.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.745
I just want you to think
of a brand that you like.

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.755
What ever that brand is.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.540
It probably stirs
up all sorts of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.255
feelings, memories,
and associations.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:54.455
This is what separates
a brand from a product.

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.210
But don't take my word for it.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.495
Seth Godin, a well-known
marketing thought leader says,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:03.380
a brand is the set of
expectations, memories, stories,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.680
and relationships that
taken together account for

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.495
consumers decision to choose

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.210
one product or
service over another.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.855
A more concise and actually
more effective definition

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:16.820
comes from Bozoma Saint John,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.700
she's the Chief Marketing
Officer of Netflix.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.755
And she says, very simply,

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:24.365
brands are like people.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.715
But how do marketers make a
brand feel like a person?

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:32.105
How can you create these
emotional associations?

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.939
The answer to this question
is pretty complex,

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.930
but brand attributes are a
very good place to start.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.640
Brand attributes are like

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.805
the personality traits people
associate with a brand.

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:47.765
Sometimes these can also be
called brand characteristics.

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:51.260
It's really hard to build
relationships with people

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.835
whose personality you just

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.920
can't put your finger on, right?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.995
The exact same thing
goes for brands.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:01.940
Brand attributes are what
distinguish a product like

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.035
coffee from a brand
like Starbucks.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.120
Let's take a look
at a few examples.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.895
Red Bull's product
is energy drinks.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.205
What the Red Bull
brand is about,

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.850
excitement, world-class feats,
and pushing the limits.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.984
Its brand attribute, edginess.

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:23.420
Tiffany's, is in the
business of selling jewelry.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.150
But the Tiffany's brand
is about celebrating

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.065
milestones, birthdays,
anniversaries, engagements.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:34.205
Its brand attribute,
connection and sophistication.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:37.280
Shifting to a younger
company, Casper.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300
Casper is in the business of
selling mattresses online.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.875
Not super exciting.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.280
But the Casper brand
is all about sleep,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.750
comfort and relaxation, about
that wonderful, safe space,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.310
that is our bedroom.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.330
It's brand attribute,
a sense of calm.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.180
For marketers and
business leaders,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.400
it's not enough to write down

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.740
some brand attributes
and just wish that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.559
your potential customers
see you as inclusive

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.635
or innovative, thrilling,
or sophisticated.

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:12.680
Your brand attributes will
ultimately shine through

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.875
in your actions and how you
choose to present yourself.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.200
The words and visuals
that represent

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.510
your brand and the feelings that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.120
those evoke are what
make one cup of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.870
coffee feel a world of a
difference from another.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.770
Cheers.
