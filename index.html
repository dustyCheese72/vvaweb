        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Right now, everything sucks, like really bad. Everything is in a state of collapse, everyone hates our 2-party system. Nobody trusts our politicians. Our entire democratic process is dictated by the empty rhetoric being regurgitated ad nauseam by the traditional media and their favored candidates. Anyway, heres some unrelated stuff about a charity that fights water scarcity:</p>

        <p>Since 2006, charity: water has funded hundreds of thousands of life-changing water projects around the world. With a global team and a mission rooted in dignity and hope, they are proving that ending the water crisis is possible—and we’re proud to join them. This work is bigger than one organization; it’s a movement. And now, it includes you. Together, we believe in a future where every person has access to clean and safe drinking water. We won't stop until that future becomes a reality.</p>

                Will used to think some wild things. Unfortunately, though the things he believes now are less wild, they are no less dire. Will has decided to stop relying on his vote to represent his interests, and has taken political action into his own hands. Will you join him?
