        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Right now, 771 million people around the world are drinking unsafe water—a crisis that leads to the deaths of 16,000 people every week. Dirty water devastates communities, forcing families into instability and robbing children, especially girls, of their education as they spend hours each day collecting water. No one should have to drink water filled with bugs, algae, and disease. But the good news is: we know how to solve this. Clean water isn’t just a need—it’s a right. And when it reaches a community, everything changes: health improves, kids return to school, and families begin to thrive.</p>

        <p>Since 2006, charity: water has funded hundreds of thousands of life-changing water projects around the world. With a global team and a mission rooted in dignity and hope, they are proving that ending the water crisis is possible—and we’re proud to join them. This work is bigger than one organization; it’s a movement. And now, it includes you. Together, we believe in a future where every person has access to clean and safe drinking water. We won't stop until that future becomes a reality.</p>

                Amina used to walk miles every day to collect water for her family. Thanks to your support, her village now has a clean water well. Amina can go to school and her family is healthier and happier.
